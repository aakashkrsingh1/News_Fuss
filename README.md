# News_Fuss
This Android Application provides latest News in a lightweight and simple UI, using RecyclerView and the opensource News API. 
I have used Glide Library for Image Processing and Volley Library for Network Requests, using an obvious Singleton Pattern.
For opening and reading articles and news, I have used Chrome Custom Tabs.
